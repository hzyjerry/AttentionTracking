#	Local Set Up
###

  This section provides instruction for setting up the app 
  and accessing it using mobile phone. The entire set up 
  should take less than 5 minutes.

  The entry point of the project is index.js. One can start 
  up the server by going into the project folder and 
  executing ‘node index.js’. 

  The Nodejs app will start running on localhost at port 5000. 
  After this step, two entry points will be created: 
  	(1) localhost:5000/vr: used for participants to explore 
  		the environment
  	(2) localhost:5000/visualize: used for researchers to 
  		examine visual attention in real time. 

  Note that entry point (1) fetches IMU data provided by mobile 
  browser. if the app is run it inside computer browser, an 
  exception will be raised saying no compass is detected. 

  In order to use mobile device to access the same entry point, 
  one need to make sure that the computer and mobile device are 
  in the same network in this scenario. One can simply access 
  the web app by typing in compterIP:5000/vr on mobile web 
  browser. The computerIP can be found by running ‘ipconfig’, 
  or by executing the following command inside node command 
  line tool 

  	Terminal>> npm install ip
  	Terminal>> node
  	Node>> var ip = require(‘ip’);
	Node>> console.dir(ip.address());

#	AMT Set Up Guideline (source code not included)
###

  To set up and deploy the app on Amazon Mechanical Turk, 
  one needs to follow the AMT manual to set up HIT jobs, 
  task specifications and task prices. In order for Mechanical 
  Turkers to understand the task, one also needs to provide an 
  UI with task specification using HITLayout, and a way for 
  Turkers to access the web app on their mobile phone. To 
  increase flexibility, this UI is not included inside the 
  source code. A potential pipeline is discussed in detail in 
  the paper.
